# Occupational Fatalities Analysis in the US (2011-2021)

This repository contains an analysis of occupational fatalities in the United States from 2011 to 2021. The data wrangling and cleaning processes have been performed using Python's pandas library, and the visualizations have been created using Tableau and Seaborn.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from [National Safety Council](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/state-data/at-work/work-deaths-by-state/). It provides information on occupational fatalities, fatality rates and event of death in various states within the United States for the 2011 - 2021

## Data Wrangling and Cleaning

The data wrangling and cleaning tasks were accomplished using Python's pandas library. The main steps involved in this process were:
- Loading the raw data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Handling missing or null values.
- Ensuring data consistency and correcting any inconsistencies.
- Data type conversions if necessary.
- Aggregating the data for better analysis.

The code for data wrangling and cleaning can be found in the `Occupational Fatalities in United States.ipynb` notebook in this repository.

## Visualizations

After cleaning the data, various visualizations were created to gain insights into the occupational fatalities trends. Two main tools were used for visualizations:

### Tableau
Tableau was utilized to create interactive and insightful visualizations, allowing for better exploration and understanding of the data. The Tableau workbook file can be found in the root directory.

### Seaborn
Seaborn, a Python data visualization library, was also used to generate static visualizations for a more in-depth analysis of the data. The Seaborn visualizations are available in the `Occupational Fatalities in United States .ipynb` notebook.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Occupational Fatalities in United States.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data wranglingm cleaning code using pandas and Seaborn visualizations
- `Analysis of Occupational Fatality US.twbx/`: Tableau workbook containing the Tableau visualization file.

## Usage

To replicate the data wrangling process and visualize the data using Seaborn, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install pandas seaborn`.
3. Run the `Occupational Fatalities in United States.ipynb` notebook to perform data wrangling, cleaning and explore the Seaborn visualizations.

For Tableau visualizations, you will need Tableau software to open and interact with the Tableau workbook. Alternatively you can view Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hazeed.harshad/viz/AnalysisofOccupationalFatalitiesinUS/AnalysisofOccupationalFatalitiesinUS)
